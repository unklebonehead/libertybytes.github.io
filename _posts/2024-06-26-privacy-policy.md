### There isn't one. I do not track you or your presence here. I am not a stalker and you shouldn't be either. It's not a very healthy way to live. You should probably go outside and touch grass or seek professional help if you are stalking me.

### Comments

Are not allowed on this site. If you wish to leave comments please contact me on Ecency.com or one of the other social media sites I am on.

### Media

The majority of the audio/video media is hosted on [Cast.Garden](https://cast.garden) & [Rumble](https://rumble.com). Some content of the audio/video contain copy written material that is used with express permission from the holders with the intent to provide free advertisement of the performers. I am not paid to play any content and do not attempt to make any monetary gain from them. I want you to go buy the music and merch from the artists.

### Cookies?

Are awesome. Best served with a glass of ice cold milk.

### Who I share your data with?

Nobody. As already mentioned I dont even know you are here looking in through the windows. Although keep in mind that the video players are from either CastGarden or Rumble and most likely do contain trackers of some kind. Im pretty sure both of them are interested in knowing if one of the videos is being watched at some point. They arent in it just to provide a free service. Use the players at your own risk.

### How long we retain your data?

Never. Dont have it, cant keep it.

### What rights you have over your data?

You should have all of them. It's your data after all. Stop giving it up to the big tech companies and get on decentralized social media like Mastadon, Ecency & Dbuzz. Go back to hosting your own website/blog. Use things like Tor and i2p. Use apps such as XMPP and Matrix instead of WhatsApp and Discord.

### Where your data is sent

With big tech who knows? It's usually the highest paying customer (the US government). Did you know that Google has a profile they have built on every user over the many years that they've had an account. That includes people in the USA that are now old enough to drink, vote. **There are adults alive right now that have a Google profile from the day they were born!** That company knows literally everything about them.

### Why did they do this?

Because they see humans as a product they sell to advertisers and we let them do it for some "free" stuff.

We all should be ashamed of ourselves for allowing it!
